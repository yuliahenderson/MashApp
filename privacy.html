    <h2 id="what-our-privacy-policy-covers">WHAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information that we obtain in various contexts, including when you communicate with us or access or use our Properties.</p>

    <p>We may provide different or additional privacy notices in connection with certain activities, programs, and offerings. Additionally, we may provide “just-in-time” notices or notices at collection that may supplement or clarify our privacy practices or provide you with additional choices regarding your personal information.</p>

    <h2 id="personal-information-we-collect-from-you">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>
    <p>We use the term “personal information” – also called “personal data” or “personally identifiable information” in the laws of some jurisdictions – to refer to information that reasonably identifies, relates to, describes, or can be associated with you. Data that has been deidentified or that otherwise cannot reasonably be related back to a specific person is not considered personal information. The precise definition of personal information may vary depending on your place of residence, but we take the same general approach to protecting your privacy, subject to any additional measures that may be required by applicable laws.</p>

    <p>The following are the categories and types of personal information that we may collect from or about you, depending on how you interact with the Properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifiers, such as your name and email address;</li>
        <li>Visual information, such as photos and pictures of yourself;</li>
        <li>Device information, including your device model, App version, and iOS version;</li>
        <li>Geolocation or other information that permits us to determine your location;</li>
        <li>Any other personal information that you voluntarily provide us.</li>

One such provider is Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help analyze how users use the Website. The information generated by these cookies about your use (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on activity for its staff, and providing other services relating to web page activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. By using the Website and accepting cookies, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Please refer to the currently available opt-outs for Google Analytics by visiting <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.</p>

    <h3>From Other Sources</h3>
    <p>We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as data analytics providers, fraud prevention vendors, vendors that provide other services on our behalf, or publicly available sources.</p>

    <h2 id="how-we-use-your-personal-information">HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We collect and use personal information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong>, which may include: contacting you about and providing you with our services; responding to your direct inquiries, requests, issues or feedback, and providing customer service; and adding you to our mailing lists and sending you emails from time to time;</li>
        <li><strong>To provide our products and services</strong>, which may include: operating the Properties, and providing you with any specific services that you have requested; creating, maintaining, and otherwise managing your account, profile, or subscription; and delivering content and product and service offerings relevant to your interests.</li>

        <li><strong>To comply with legal obligations</strong>, which may include: compliance with legal or regulatory obligations, establishing or exercising our rights, and to defending against a legal claim; responding to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, legal process, or governmental regulation; acting in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding or the sale, merger, or change of control of the Company or the division responsible for the services with which your information is associated;</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We reserve the right to supplement your personal information with information we gather from other sources which may include online and offline sources. We may collect information that is not personal information (“non-personal information”), including anonymous or aggregate data, or information lawfully made available from federal, state, or local government records. Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use, and disclose such information for any purpose permitted by law. In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information. If we combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information to the extent that it is capable of personally identifying you. We reserve the right to develop and derive aggregate data (meaning information that relates to a group or category of individuals, from which individual identities have been removed) from personal information in order to enhance and maintain the Properties, and such aggregate data will be treated as non-personal information.</p>

    <h2 id="how-we-disclose-or-share-your-personal-information">HOW WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>In addition to using your personal information ourselves for the reasons stated above (and as otherwise mentioned in this Privacy Policy), we may disclose your personal information to other affiliates and entities in the following instances:</p>

They are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit.</p>

    <h3>Legal Compliance and to Defend Our Rights</h3>
    <p>We may disclose personal information and other information as we believe necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our Terms and Conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</p>
